**Tools used**:

Python (version 3.8)
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

**Analysis**:

For this project, I was interested in employing Stack Overflow 2022 data to gain a deeper understanding of:

1. What are the top ten nations that respondents are from?
2. Does knowing more languages result in higher salaries?
3. What are the highest-paying languages?
4. Are the highest-paying languages in line with the most practiced languages by the entire workforce?
5. What languages do respondents want to work with in the future?


The analysis for the above questions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@saipriyakasturi121/the-impact-of-programming-language-competence-on-salary-94f737dec22b)

**Conclusion**:

The Stack Overflow Survey 2022 reveals IT sector language preferences and high-earning programming languages. Nonetheless, pay is affected by the experience, job position, and sector. To maximize earnings, professionals must learn new programming languages and technologies. A strategy and market analysis are required before deciding on a programming language.
