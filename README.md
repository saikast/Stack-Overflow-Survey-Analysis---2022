**Analysis:**

For this project, I was interested in Stack Overflow 2022 data to better understand:

1. What are the top ten countries respondents belong to?
2. Does knowing more number of languaes result in higher salaries?
3. What are the languages that earned the highest salaries?
4. Are the highest-paying languages in accordance with rest of the workforce?
5. What languages do respondents want to work with in the future?


**Conclusion:**

The Stack Overflow Survey 2022 reveals IT sector language preferences and high-earning programming languages. Nevertheless, experience, work position, and industry all affect pay. To optimize earnings, professionals must master new programming languages and technologies. Before choosing a programming language, you need a strategy and market analysis.
